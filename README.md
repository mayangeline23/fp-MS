# Health Disease Prediction

by: Ydonna Pearl Quiano, May Angeline Regaspi and Joy Ann Ruin

#Project Overview
This project aims to build a health disease prediction model using synthetic health data. The goal is to predict the risk of diseases based on factors such as age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and lifestyle choices. By utilizing modeling and simulation techniques, the project provides insights into how health risks can be managed effectively.

Key Features:
Synthetic Data Generation: Create realistic health data to simulate various health conditions.
Predictive Modeling: Train machine learning models to predict the likelihood of health diseases.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the models' accuracy using different metrics to determine the best-performing model.
